If you manage to get lots of free spins, the coins can quickly mount up. The game, although different in theme, is identical in terms of gameplay to NetEnt’s EggOMatic which is a good slot.',

        'The same visual fidelity, spiral pattern, Cluster Pays, and Avalanche mechanic that appealed to so many players are back. Despite its technical marvels, the original slots fizzled out quickly. Some described the payouts as lackluster, gameplay as monotonous, and not to mention the small jackpot. If we have to make a prediction on the back of the previous game as to how this one would fare, we’re afraid it might also bomb out. Alas!

The grid setup is also a little eccentric and alternates between a 5x5 and a 1-3-5-7-5-3-1 arrangement that mixes up the gameplay. Interestingly, both configurations use the same number of paylines – 40, though the expanded version pulls in more wilds, which we will look at.',
        'To fire up the machine, users select bet levels from 1-10 and coin values from 0.01 – 0.50. Playing with these configurations means total stakes of 20 p/c up to £/€100 per spin. Look to land combinations of at least 3 of a kind for a payout, and when expanded rows are in play 7 symbol combos are possible.',

Five of him pay 25 times the stake, or if you get lucky with a line of seven, that will score you a whopping 175 times the stake. Across the paytable, getting seven of a kind is worth 6 times what five of a kind is worth. True to its name, there are plenty of wild symbols to help things along. Combinations of the standard 1x1 wild are worth as much as the Doc symbol, and wilds also substitutes for any other pay symbol.',

In saying so, there are recognisable elements, such as the expanding symbols which draws the mind to Book of Ra. Hot Spots trigger respins quite frequently to keep the base game going, and their presentation on the tottering wooden frame is well designed. Free spins are a lot tougher to trigger of course, where the extra rows are a welcome addition, expanding not only reel but the game’s potential.',
        'However, the irregularity of free spins didn’t seem to have much positive effect on their value, which tended to the low side most of the time. It’s certainly no Hall of Gods. Where the older jackpot game has a track record as one of the highest playing slots of all time, Riches of Midgard is a lot more modest. Single spin wins max at out 435 times the bet when the grid is fully expanded during the bonus. So, this Midgard isn’t super-rich, though the game is set before corporate-led governments fuelled the capitalist gangbang we find ourselves in today. So maybe NetEnt went for a level of historical accuracy.',
        'To sum up, Riches of Midgard contains a dose of originality, yet its cartoon looks blunt the edge Norse slots often provide.

However, landing a max win sounds like a sort of fiction, as this happens only once in 166 billion spins.

        'Fans of the four friends Kenny, Cartman, Stan and Kyle on the epic South Park Reel Chaos slot, your prayers have been heard, although to a part only. After deciding not to extend the license with the rights owners, NetEnt discontinued in 2018 the two South Park slots much to the dismay of the huge following they gathered over the years.',
        'But there is good news as NetEnt decided to take the mechanics from the originals and gave them new heroes and graphics on the Arcane Reel Chaos slot. They will unleash their superpowers on the reels with four base game features and a free spins round with four stages.',
        'The first impression is slightly underwhelming at first. We’ve come to expect visual stunners from this developer, but Arcane Germs is not Quickspin’s finest looking slot. It isn’t ugly; it’s just a little rough around the edges. The graphics have a grainy look to them with jagged edges, not the usual high-def standard you usually get from the Quickspin team.',
        'Let’s cross off a few technical details before tackling the limited list of features. First is stakes, which players can select from the low roller friendly cost of 10 p/c up to £/€50 per spin for those with higher betting requirements. No problem with the RTP which has been rated 96.05% with the bulk of it allocated to respins. The math model runs on medium+ volatility rated at 3.5/5 by the developers.',

        'Book of Dead is a video slot that runs on the Play’n GO software platform. The slot features 5 reels and 10 paylines, and it is inspired with an Ancient Egypt, and their culture. The game follows the explorer Rich Wild and his adventures. The slot has an incredible design with 5 brown reels set against the golden ornate frame. Players are welcome to give this game a spin here for fun, or to visit any of the Play’n GO Casinos to play for real.',
        'The Book symbol is both the Scatter and the Wild. When it acts as the Wild, it is a replacement for any symbol and helps players form a winning combination. As the Scatter symbol, the Book triggers 10 Free Spins feature, which is activated when at least 3 Scatters land simultaneously anywhere on the reels.',
        'Before the Free Spins feature starts, an ordinary symbol is randomly chosen to act as a special expanding symbol during the entire round. Once players win their prizes for regular winning combinations, the special symbol may expand to cover all three positions on its reels. The special symbol will expand only when additional prizes can be won on the active paylines. Expanded symbols do not need to appear next to each other to form a winning combination.',
        'Book of Dead is the high variance slot and it bears high resemblance to Novomatic land based slot, which is probably one of the reasons why this slot is popular. The design is excellent and the features tend to have high winning potential, but before you hit the reels we advise you to arm yourself with patience.',
